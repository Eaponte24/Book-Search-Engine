# Book Search Engine




## Description




This application provides the user with a fun and simple way to search for books they are interested in and provides a way for them to save those books. This book search engine allows the user to log in or sign up and begin saving books to their account that only they will be able to see for their needs. Logged in users are able to not only save the books to their account but also remove books from their account as well. Once the user has logged out they will still be able to search books but will not be given the option to save those books.

Once a book is saved, there will be a prompt that comes up that says "This book has already been saved" so you won't be able to double save books.

## Features


This application allows the user to create an account and be able to save books under their account so no one else can view them. Once the user has no need for those saved books anymore, they can delete those books and keep adding more afterwards. If a user does not want to make an account, they are still able to freely search books at their leisure but they will not be able to save any. This application is built using the MERN stack, utilizing a Mongo Database as well as using graphQL and apollo server.
